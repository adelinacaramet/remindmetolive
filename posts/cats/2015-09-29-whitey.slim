            p He loves to play a lot, he always jumps around. He is really loving, he used to
              come to me very often to be petted. I really like the combination of deep, blue eyes
              and white fur.

            p I took this picture when he was only 4 months old. I took him a little bit by
              surprise while he was lying on the couch.

            p To get this nice bokeh, I used my fast 35mm Sigma lens, wide open.
