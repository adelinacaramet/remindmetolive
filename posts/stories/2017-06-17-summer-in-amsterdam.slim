        h1 Summer in Amsterdam

        p I usually need a few days to take a few good photos in a new city. I took
          me 3 hours to take the ones in Amsterdam. That says a lot! The weather was
          great, the sky was blue and perfect—with mushy clouds—and the light was nice.
          In the summer, the sun stays up on the sky until late and as the city center
          is round, there are always a few sunny streets, with good light!
          You only have to search for them!

      h2.text-center Amsterdam—A Lively City
      p Amsterdam is in continuous movement! Tourists and locals are swarming the
        small streets of Netherlands' capital. At every corner there is something
        happening. Here is a nice square, with people resting in the sun and here
        is another one, where somebody is entertaining the toursits with a show!

      p It's no surprise that Amsterdam has lots of 
        <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canals_of_Amsterdam">canals</a>.
        There are kilometers of canals, about 90 islands and 1,500 bridges here.
        Plenty of space for the tourists to do cruises around the city. Considering
        how many canals there are, boats can be a good option for getting
        from one part of the city to another. Or to throw a boat party!

      h2.text-center The Bicyles in Amsterdam
      p Amsterdam is the most bicycle friendly capital of Europe.
        There are bikes everywhere around you. Some people are talking on the phone while
        riding, others are writing phone messages, eating or even checking Facebook.
        As a tourist, you have to always be careful, to see from which direction is the
        next person riding a bike coming from! They are also fast! As a matter of fact,
        while I was watching the streets, I was almost sure that every biker is millimetrically
        avoiding the others. I've never seen any collision, but keeping in mind how
        close they were, I was expecting one anytime!

      h2.text-center The Architecture
      p When it comes to architecture, Amsterdam is full of surprises. You can find
        small houses from the 17th century as well as large museums, palaces or cathedrals.
        The typical houses in the center have are made out of bricks and have big windows.
        Each of them has a hook on top, so that the people leaving there are able to
        carry their furniture in. Sometimes the houses are not perfectly aligned—this
        makes them look funny.

      p Did I miss anything? "Yes, sure, you did't say anything about the nightlife!"—someone
        screams from the back. And I immediately answer: "I don't have any photos of that, as
        what happens in Amsterdam... you know... But trust me, it's great!"

      p I can only share that during the day, you can enjoy the good weather on one of the banks
        of one of the may canals, together with somebody you love. Relax and let the sun do its job!
